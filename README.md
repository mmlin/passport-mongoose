passport-mongoose
=================

MongoDB username and password authentication strategy for Passport using Mongoose.

I'll add a user guide when I feel it's ready to use/fork.

Todo
----

- Salt and hash passwords (both as functions that can be overridden)
- Add utility methods to create users
- Add concept of a user profile to extend the user object
